Pharmacy Supply Management within healthcare systems is assessed with a particular emphasis on the distribution of medicines from wholesalers to clinics. Currently, there are issues with the service levels provided to clinics that need to be addressed. The importance of this paper lies in offering a comprehensive analysis of a healthcare supply chain in the developing world and diagnosing the factors involved in inventory management.

Pharmaceutical practices have developed over time to cover all aspects of pharmacy. These practices include the dispensing of medications, consultation services, drug regulation, and the sale of pharmaceuticals. Implementing an Online Pharmaceutical Management System would support pharmaceutical practices for all stakeholders. It is crucial that the system offers a safe, secure, and verified platform for everyone involved, helping to bridge communication gaps and ensure the provision of genuine drugs. By strictly adhering to all recommendations, there will be rigorous monitoring and regulation of drug distribution, leading to a reduction in the spread of counterfeit drugs.
